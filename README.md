2. `make db-restore`

make up - build and run containers,
make db-restore - create positions table with data.

dump.sql - this is a dump of the position table with prepared data or you can execute a similar script pg.sql

Execute script:
`make db-script path=<path-to-filename>` - path=select.sql by default
